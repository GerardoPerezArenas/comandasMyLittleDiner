# Build Fix Documentation

## Issue Resolved
The project was failing to build due to an invalid Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version specified in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.

### Problem
- **Original AGP version**: `8.12.1` (does not exist)
- **Error**: `Plugin [id: 'com.android.application', version: '8.12.1'] was not found`

### Solution
- **Updated AGP version**: `8.2.2` (stable and verified version)
- **File changed**: `gradle/libs.versions.toml`

### Changes Made
```diff
[versions]
- agp = "8.12.1"
+ agp = "8.2.2"
```

## Network Connectivity Requirements
This project requires access to the following repositories for building:
- `dl.google.com` (Google's Android repository)
- `repo1.maven.org` (Maven Central)
- `plugins.gradle.org` (Gradle Plugin Portal)

### If Build Still Fails
If you encounter network connectivity issues like:
```
dl.google.com: No address associated with hostname
```

This indicates a network configuration issue. Ensure your build environment has:
1. Internet access
2. Ability to resolve DNS for the above domains
3. No corporate firewall blocking these repositories

## Verified Compatible Versions
The following AGP versions are confirmed to exist and work:
- `8.2.2` (recommended)
- `8.1.4`
- `8.0.2`
- `7.4.2`

## Build Instructions
Once network connectivity is available:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug  # Build debug APK
./gradlew test          # Run unit tests
```
